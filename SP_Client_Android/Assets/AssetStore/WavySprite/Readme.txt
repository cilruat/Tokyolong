WavySprite by Andrii Sudyn

Online manual: http://ax23w4.com/devlog/wavysprite

To add a WavySprite object to you scene, go to:
GameObject > 2D Object > WavySprite

To assign a sprite to it - drag a sprite into a Texture field.

Tint, Sorting layer and Order in layer fields work in the same 
way as they do for sprites.

Lit checkbox will allow you to switch to Diffuse material which
reacts to light sources.

Divisions X and Y will allow you to set the level of detail
for a mesh, generated by the asset. After changing it, you
will see triangle count increase or decrease on top of
WavySprite inspector to show how many triangles are used in
the mesh.

Wave direction allows you to choose from vertical and horisontal
sine waves. Keep in mind that rotating the sprite will not rotate
the direction.

Static side allows you to choose which side of the object to keep
unmoving.

Wave frequency, force and speed will change the properties 
of the sine waves generated by the shader.
