These are ONLY some of the models made by Kenney set as prefabs. You can also create your own.

All these models can be found in the Models folder in the Nature Pack Extended folder. You can add any models you 
like in the scene and also set them as props, prefabs or target objects. You can fill in the scenes with them and add
some trees or such. To set the models as target objects you need to add a collider (box, mesh or so) and then tag the 
model with the 'TargetObject' tag. Be sure that you selected the mesh of the model if you are using the mesh collider. 

The pack includes over 100 models thanks to Kenney. Enjoy!
