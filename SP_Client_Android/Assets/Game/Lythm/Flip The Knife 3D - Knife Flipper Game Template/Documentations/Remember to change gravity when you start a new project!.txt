PLEASE NOTE:

WHEN YOU IMPORT THE PROJECT AND THE GRAVITY IS TOO HIGH, YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE IT FROM THE 
EDIT > PROJECT SETTINGS > PHYSICS AND MAKE THE Y AXIS TO Y: -3.5 or just put the Change Scene Gravity Auto Prefab from the settings folder into a scene.

This is important step to do, because otherwise your weapon will have a higher gravity because unity resets it automatically
when you open up a new project and your weapon will fall with more impact.

In the settings folder there is a prefab called Change Scene Gravity Auto which automatically will change the gravity of each scene IF you put it onto your scene. 
What this script does is it will change the gravity of the scene when so it will be better, because if the gravity is too high then the weapon will not flip correctly, 
so you need to tweak it a bit and this prefab will do it automatically, so it is important to drag and drop the Change Scene Gravity Auto prefab in your scene.

If you want to do it manually and you don’t need to put the Change Scene Gravity Auto prefab in each and every scene, then you can change the project’s gravity by going 
in the Edit > Project Settings > Physics and there you will see Gravity in the Physics Manager. Change the gravity of Y: to -3.5
