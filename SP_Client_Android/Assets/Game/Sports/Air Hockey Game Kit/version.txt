version 2.0 - 2017_12_15

* This is a major update - Let me know if anything broke in the process.
And please : Always backup first before trying to update an existing project ! *

- Deprecated UnityScript (in line with Unity's updated UAS publishing rules)
- (finally !) switched game UI from custom one to Unity's uGUI
- Set minimum compatible version to Unity Editor 5.4.5f1
- Debug GUI is now disabled by default - you can enable it by checking 'Show Debug GUI' in MainScript inspector.
- There is some undocumented code in MainScript.cs regarding player levelling as example

Known issues :
- There is a know Unity bug regarding Touch Screen handling according to Unity versions and build platforms.
However it is hard to track, i'll do my best to help if you encounter it and need support.
