  Installation
----------------------

1- Import the plugin package into a Unity project.

2- Open the example scenes (Asses/I2/MiniGames/Examples/Scenes/MiniGames.unity)
   The scene contains a few examples of each game and how it can be setup for each particular behavior/look

3- Also there are prebuit prefabs (Asses/I2/MiniGames/Prefabs) with the basic implementation of the MiniGames.
   This prefabs, can be dragged into your scenes, link the callbacks for monetizations and they are 
   ready to go, including the monetization flow
   
   For each prefab, an NGUI and Unity UI version is provided.


The documentation provides further explanaition on each of those steps and some tutorials.
